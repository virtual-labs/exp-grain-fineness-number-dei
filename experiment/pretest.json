      "question": "What does the Grain Fineness Number (GFN) measure in a sand sample? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The weight of the sand sample",
        "b": "The permeability of the sand",
        "c": "The average grain size of the sand",
        "d": "The moisture content of the sand"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The Grain Fineness Number (GFN) represents the average size of sand grains in a sample. It is a crucial parameter in sand casting because grain size directly affects the quality of the mould and the final casting. A higher GFN indicates finer grains, which provide a smoother surface finish but may reduce permeability, while a lower GFN represents coarser grains, which improve permeability but can lead to surface defects like metal penetration.",

      "question": "Which of the following factors affects the Grain Fineness Number (GFN) in a sand metal casting process? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Pouring temperature",
        "b": "Type of metal used",
        "c": "Desired surface finish",
        "d": "All of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The Grain Fineness Number (GFN) is influenced by multiple factors that impact casting quality. Type of metal used: Different metals require different moulding sands to ensure proper solidification and prevent casting defects. Pouring temperature: Higher temperatures can cause finer sand grains to fuse, altering the GFN. Desired surface finish: A smoother finish requires finer sand (high GFN), while coarser sand (low GFN) is used for better permeability and gas escape.",

      "question": "What is the effect of using a sand sample with a high GFN? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Increased permeability and gas defects",
        "b": "Low permeability, leading to gas defects",
        "c": "High metal penetration and rough surface finish",
        "d": "Increased burn-in and burn-on defects"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A high GFN indicates finer sand grains, which pack tightly together, reducing the gaps between particles. This results in low permeability, making it difficult for gases and moisture to escape from the mould during casting. When gases get trapped, they create defects like gas porosity, pinholes, and blowholes, negatively affecting the casting's integrity.",

      "question": "What is the purpose of using a sieve shaker? (LO2)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To melt sand grains for better fineness",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A sieve shaker is used to determine the distribution of grain sizes within a sand sample. It vibrates and passes the sand through a series of sieves, each with different mesh sizes, separating the grains based on their size and weight. This process helps in analysing the grain fineness number (GFN) and ensures the right sand is selected for casting applications.",

      "question": "How does an incorrect Grain Fineness Number (GFN) affect the final casting quality? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It can lead to surface defects such as roughness or gas porosity",
        "b": "It has no impact on the final casting quality",

        "a": "An incorrect GFN can negatively impact casting quality in multiple ways.If GFN is too high (finer sand): Low permeability may cause gas porosity and blowholes, as trapped gases cannot escape easily. If GFN is too low (coarser sand) High permeability can lead to metal penetration, burn-on defects, and rough surface finish. Maintaining the correct GFN is essential to achieving a balance between permeability and surface finish, ensuring a defect-free casting.",
