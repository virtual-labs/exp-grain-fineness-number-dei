### To find the distribution of sand grains using a set of sieves and to find the average grain fineness number

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES

LO1: To define Grain Fineness Number (GFN) and explain its significance in sand testing.

LO2: To understand how the sieve shaker mechanism works in separating sand grains based on size.

LO3: To perform the sieve shaker experiment and compute the Grain Fineness Number (GFN) using the formula.
