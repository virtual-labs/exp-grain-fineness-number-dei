### Procedure
* CHOOSE the amount of sand sample to be tested
* WEIGH the amount of sand sample using the electronic weighing machine
* ARRANGE the sieves in increasing order of the sieve number (bottom to top)
* TRANSFER the sand sample to the topmost sieve
* CLAMP the sieves with the sand sample inside
* Switch ON the sieve shaker and let it agitate for 10-15 minutes
* Switch OFF and DECLAMP the apparatus
* WEIGH the sand samples divided into the sieves separately
* CALCULATE the percentage retained for every division
* CALCULATE the product by multiplying the retained retained percentage in every sieve with the multiplying factor
* CALCULATE cumulative values for percentage retained and product. Divide them to obtain Average Grain Fineness (AFN) number
